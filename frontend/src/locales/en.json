			},
			{
				"q": "How does BYOK work?",
				"a": "Bring Your Own Key (BYOK) allows you to connect your own API keys from providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google. You only pay for what you use directly to the provider."
			},
			{
				"q": "Is my data private?",

				"q": "What is Vector Memory?",
